## About This Repository

This is my workspace for **DESN 378 Code + Design 2** also known as **Web Design 2** (or in the future, **Web Design + Code 2**) at Eastern Washington University. **The question this course asks:** How should things behave? In DESN 368, I learned how to make things look right. Here, I'm learning how to make things behave right — treating code as a design material with properties, behaviors, and constraints, just like paint, paper, or clay. Throughout the quarter, I'll work with four digital materials: CSS systems, SVG, animation libraries, and generative code — learning how each responds to manipulation and what each makes possible. Unlike courses focused on user research or backend engineering, this one asks: How does it feel? By the end, this repo will become my portfolio.

## Learning Log

Update this section each week with observations, breakthroughs, and questions.

### Week 0: The On-Ramp // DevTools, console, script linking

### What I Learned
<!-- What concepts clicked for you? What was new? -->​
What I learned in week-0 was understanding how the console works. Within the console I learned how to have interactions happen with JavaScript. Such as pop ups whne entering the page. I think that was one of the biggest concepts that cliked this week. Another concept is using (console.log), this was easy to undertand and start uisng in the JavaScript and Console.
​
### What Was Hard
<!-- What frustrated you? What didn't make sense? -->
This is a whole new learning curve for me. There is lost of stuff that hasn't clicked yet, but will eventually. The behavior layer assignmnet was one of the hardest assignents that I've had so far. I think having everything communicate together isn't clicking or not making sense at the moment. This was frustating at times. I had to have Claude help me with some of the code because I didn;t understand what I was doing wrong or sometimes how to type it. I think there is lots that I still have to figure out and understand but I know I will get it eventually.​
​
### How I Used AI
<!-- Did you use Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.? How did it help or not help? -->
The biggest way AI was able to help me was by helping undertand some of the code for JavaScript and undertanding some of the functions. I used Claude for all the coding that I needed help with. It's my go to model when I'm stuck. I would say it helped pretty well, but I want to go back and ask it more questions. So I can have a better understanding of what I leanred. I think there was times whne it was trying to do the work for me and that was frustating becuase it wasn't teaching me what to do. I would say AI is defienlty something I will be using whne stuck or to better understanding when I'm not in class.​
​
### What's Still Unclear
<!-- What questions do you still have? What needs more practice? -->
I think the biggest question that I have this week is going to be how interations work. I'm having a hard time wording it out and typing it out. Also, querySelector(), addEventListener(), and localStorage. I'm still more confused on how these work and talk to each other, to make things like the pop up interaction on the page. Where you have to type your name and you can enter the page. Still not sure about that. I think that's something I have questions about and more practice.​

### Week 1: Systems That Respond

### What I Learned
<!-- What concepts clicked for you? What was new? -->
During Week-1 there was lots that I learned. There was ups and downs. I don't think really naything clicked this week. I leanred how to click on pictures and make them chnage to orientate to differnt pictures. That was uisng JavaScript. I alos leanred more about Design Systems and Deisgn tokens. Being able to use these things within my designs will help me so much and make me a better/efficent designer.​
​
### What Was Hard
<!-- What frustrated you? What didn't make sense? -->
I think after Week-1. There has been lots that has frustrated me. I'm still trying undertand JavaSrcipt and the funtions that can occure in JavaScript. I'm having a hard time understanding how the funtiosn work and how to make things works. Some of it is starting to make sense, but it going to take some time for me to understand. This is really what is frustating me at the moment and after Week-1.​
​
### How I Used AI
<!-- Did you use Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.? How did it help or not help? -->
Over Week-1 I used Claude Sonnet 4.5. There was lots of ways that it was helping me. I recenlt y have been helping me understand JavaScript and how it works. I've been using it to help fix and structure my code correclty. The buggest thing that I've been using it for was debugging and figuring out why the thing I created isn't working. I've been using CodePilot in GitHub to help me checking to make sur ethings are working and connected properly. This is how I've been using AI in Week-1.​
​
### What's Still Unclear
<!-- What questions do you still have? What needs more practice? -->
I think there is still a lot unclear. The biggets quetsion is what is the best way to approch understanding how what we did in our Behaviroal-Layer and Story-teller asignments on how it works and funtions. I think just trying to undertand JavaScript is what I need more pratice one. This is what is still unclear on Week-1.


### Week 2: Remembering Choices
​
### What I Learned
During week-2 I leanred deisgn variable within Figma. I learned how to use them and create them. Leanred and have little bit better of understanding of Design tokens. I staeted to apply them to my porfolio and how to switch light and dark mode. I leanred of the better wasy of creating a style guide, which will help me become a more efficent deisgner. I'm excited to strat uisng them within in CSS to make me a better designer/coder. This is what I learned within week-2.
​
### What Was Hard
I think the hardest part for week-2 was figuring out and setting up variables within Figma and using them within the design. I struggled with applying differnt ways of changing the color with dark and light mode. But figured it out eventually. I'm still trying to figure out some of JavaScript but are slowly starting to undertsnad it. This is what was hard in week-2.
​
### How I Used AI
How I ued AI in week-2 was in a couple of differnt ways. I used Claude Sonnet 4.5 to help me understand some more JavaScript. I asked to help with some of my Figma Variables and helping me with the naming of them for my project. I think Ai helped with the understanding this week especially with JavaScript. I have a better understanding and also a better undertsatnding how to name my Figma Variables in a more profesional way. This is how I used AI in week-2.
​
### What's Still Unclear
The only thing that still unclear in week-2 is some of the things about JavaScript. I'm still havinga super hard time understanding it and figure out how to do some of it. I think I understadn queryselctor the most. Which is great. I ahve Web Development 1 which is helping with Code + Design 2 with Javasceipt. I don;t relaly have any quetsion for this week, but porboly will have some in week-3. These are still the things that are unclear in Week-2.
