## About This Repository

This is my workspace for **DESN 378 Code + Design 2** also known as **Web Design 2** (or in the future, **Web Design + Code 2**) at Eastern Washington University. **The question this course asks:** How should things behave? In DESN 368, I learned how to make things look right. Here, I'm learning how to make things behave right — treating code as a design material with properties, behaviors, and constraints, just like paint, paper, or clay. Throughout the quarter, I'll work with four digital materials: CSS systems, SVG, animation libraries, and generative code — learning how each responds to manipulation and what each makes possible. Unlike courses focused on user research or backend engineering, this one asks: How does it feel? By the end, this repo will become my portfolio.

## Learning Log

Update this section each week with observations, breakthroughs, and questions.

### Week 0: The On-Ramp // DevTools, console, script linking

### What I Learned
<!-- What concepts clicked for you? What was new? -->​
What I learned in week-0 was understanding how the console works. Within the console I learned how to have interactions happen with JavaScript. Such as pop ups whne entering the page. I think that was one of the biggest concepts that cliked this week. Another concept is using (console.log), this was easy to undertand and start uisng in the JavaScript and Console.
​
### What Was Hard
<!-- What frustrated you? What didn't make sense? -->
This is a whole new learning curve for me. There is lost of stuff that hasn't clicked yet, but will eventually. The behavior layer assignmnet was one of the hardest assignents that I've had so far. I think having everything communicate together isn't clicking or not making sense at the moment. This was frustating at times. I had to have Claude help me with some of the code because I didn;t understand what I was doing wrong or sometimes how to type it. I think there is lots that I still have to figure out and understand but I know I will get it eventually.​
​
### How I Used AI
<!-- Did you use Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.? How did it help or not help? -->
The biggest way AI was able to help me was by helping undertand some of the code for JavaScript and undertanding some of the functions. I used Claude for all the coding that I needed help with. It's my go to model when I'm stuck. I would say it helped pretty well, but I want to go back and ask it more questions. So I can have a better understanding of what I leanred. I think there was times whne it was trying to do the work for me and that was frustating becuase it wasn't teaching me what to do. I would say AI is defienlty something I will be using whne stuck or to better understanding when I'm not in class.​
​
### What's Still Unclear
<!-- What questions do you still have? What needs more practice? -->
I think the biggest question that I have this week is going to be how interations work. I'm having a hard time wording it out and typing it out. Also, querySelector(), addEventListener(), and localStorage. I'm still more confused on how these work and talk to each other, to make things like the pop up interaction on the page. Where you have to type your name and you can enter the page. Still not sure about that. I think that's something I have questions about and more practice.​
