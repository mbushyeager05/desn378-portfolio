## Design Decisions

### Dark Mode Approach
Rather than simply inverting colors, I adjusted accent colors for better contrast on dark backgrounds. The accent blue is lighter in dark mode to maintain readability.

### Theme Toggle UI
The Theme Toggle has three differnt option to be able to set whihc preference you like. Those include Light, Dark, and OS System. Whne you hover over the button, the menu open to show these options. The buttomn goes along with the theme of glass look.
