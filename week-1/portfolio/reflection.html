            <h2>The Threshold</h2>
            <p>The specific moment this quarter where "code" clicked for me is wokring with css and their parents. I think I struggled with understanding prior to this class and after lectures and writing differnt coded sites. It really strated to click. I think being able to know that is helping me fifure out differnt kinds of styling you can do in CSS. Also, CSS animations clicked super fast for me and I love using them alot. It can give really good personality to yoru doucment or site. Really anything you are creating. This was the specifc moment this quater that "clicked" for code. </p>

            <h2>The Pit</h2>
            <p>What was the hardest assignment? How did you get yourself out of the "pit of despair"? 3-5 sentences minimum]</p>
            <p>The hardest assignment was the Product Landing Page. I had a very ambitious site and design. After getting all the HTML done and ready to be styled. That's when I wanted to quit, I had so many moveable elements and animation pieces, that it was starting to feel overwhelming to code. Also, things weren’t truing out correctly at first. I think finding examples and being bel to use AI as a co-pilot to teach me helps me push through to finish the site. I learned so much building the website. By the end I was feeling proud of what I produced. But there was that point in which I wanted to quit and it put me the “pit of despair.” I think a huge lesson was to trust the process and take it slowly and not rush it to make it work and function properly. This was the hardest assignment and that’s how I got myself out of the “pit of despair.”  </p>

            <h2>The Pivot</h2>
            <p>Looking at my original “Moodz and Vibes.” I think there are some similarities and some huge difference. I think throughout each quarter my style is always changing of what I like and what I don’t.  How it compares is somewhat different than what I originally planned for. The things that I put down at the beginning of the quarter for the “Moodz and Vibes,” are things that I still like but I wanted to have more fun and challenge myself to take a different approach. I’ve really been into frosted glass and pop of color. So I wanted to see what I could do with that. I think pivoting was. Good idea in my opinion because agin it gave me the change to experiment with different CSS styles and attributes. I think the pop of color I the part that stayed from my “Mood and Vibes.” Looking at the references and the different colors I used show how I approach color and how it’s applied in my designs. This is how my portfolio changed or stayed the same from my “Moodz and Vibes.” </p>

            <h2>The Process</h2>
            <p>What I would change about how I approach this cause is have a different mindset. I think I came in with I can’t code and that I can’t finish the assignments or projects. I still at times had that mindset. I need to have the grown-mindset and appreciate the fails and issues that arise from coding. That they are a learning moment. I also would love to be able to fix my time management and how I approach the design. I think after getting the HTML structured and ready to go, I would start jumping all the place and styling which then made me feel overwhelmed because  there was so much going on in the whole document and not just going the list of the HTML. I think I would of that because I would quit working on something that wasn’t going correct and tell myself that I would come back to it. I would change that and just start pushing through. I would use AI as last resort since agin it can be your co-pilot on things like that. I think there was so much more that I could have changed about mindset coming into this course. Overall, it was. Great experience and class. I had fun designing all the different sites and problem solving. These were the things that I would change about how I approach this course.</p>

            <h2>The Future</h2>
            <p>How I see this hybrid skillset (Design + Code) impacting my future practice. IS that this new skill set I can apply for a future career. I love UX a lot so being Abel to know these skills will help me along the way and better understand code. I think the knowledge opens many paths in the design world and will continue that way since we are moving into a fully digital world. I think besides the skillset it has also change my mindset on code and that I can do it. I used to say like a year and half ago that I would never code because I just couldn’t understand it. But now I do and I could see myself working with Code and designing things. Plus working with Figma Make helps a lot with this and I can apply the skills I learned from Design + Code) to things like Figma Make or CodeX. I think (Design + Code) is something that I will use for a long time and always will. It was something that’s important for me to learn this skills set so I can apply it to jobs or just working on a personal project. I think these hybrid of (Design + Code) have a huge impact of my future practice.</p>
